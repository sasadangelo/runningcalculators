## Why others Running Calculators?

Running Calculators is not something new on the web. There are tons of Running Calculator on it but not all are good. With time I learned the pro and cons of each calculators and I started to use regurarly only few of them. The problem was that these calculators were on different websites so each time I had to look for them on Google. Some of them are on websites dedicated to fitness and running that are full of ads, video and other useless stuff that disturb the use of the software.

I am also a Programmer and I needed to learn the Javascript language for my job. When I need to learn a language I always try to create a mini project from scratch because I know this is the best approach to learn it. 

Why not try to implement a simple web page with all my favorites Running Calculators?

## How to use Running Calculators?

Access to the [Running Calculators web site](https://runningcalculators.herokuapp.com/) and select the menu option you need:

* Heart Rate Zone, calculate your training hearth zone based on max and rest heart rate. The calculator is based on [Karvonen method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate#Karvonen_method) modified. The classic Karvonen method calculate the training zone starting from maximum and rest heart rates. The maximum heart rate is estimated with the formula (220-age). The calculator allow you to use this formula only if you do not know in advance you Maximum Heart Rate. However, my suggestion is always to [calculate it on field or in a race](https://www.polar.com/blog/calculate-maximum-heart-rate-running/) because the formula is quite inaccurate. For example, according to the formula my max heart rate should be (220-43)=177 while I verified in race that it is 188.
